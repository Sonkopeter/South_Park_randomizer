# South_Park_randomizer

I like to fell asleep watching South Park, so I harassed selenium library and made myself random SP episode selector. 

This script:
- opens chrome
- goes to https://southpark.mult-fan.tv/
- bypasses 'I am not a robot' screen
- opens random episode
- selects og voiceover
- makes it full screen
- turns episode on

Basically, this thing automates 7 mouse clicks and saves 30 seconds of my life.

Despite its simplicity, this small project helped me better understand how web pages are structured.
